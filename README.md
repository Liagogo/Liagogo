- 👋 Hi, I’m @Liagogo
- 👀 I’m interested in explorative data analysis, data visualization and website designing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, R and Tableau. I have finished several vidualization and forcasting projects with R, but I am still a beginner with python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding and finishing data analysis projects, learning by doing together.
